# Overview
The programming aims to create an access point in OPTA, serving as a type of Wi-Fi "router" with username and password.
It is possible to control two output LEDs and read an OPTA analog port on a web page.
To access the website, you must connect your cell phone, tablet or computer to the Wi-Fi created by OPTA with the following credentials:
Network name: yourNetwork
Network password: yourPassword

After the device is connected to the network, you need to enter the IP 192.168.3.1 in the browser


# Goals
Learn how to create an access point (as if it were a router) on an OPTA so that a cell phone, computer or other OPTA can connect to this generated network.

# Finder OPTA and the Access Point

Creating an access point in OPTA is the same thing as creating a Wi-Fi network, but without internet access.
This type of application serves several functions, one of the main ones being the creation of a network without internet access for security reasons or even a bad signal.
